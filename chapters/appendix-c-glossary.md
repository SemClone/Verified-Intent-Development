# Appendix C: Glossary

**Graduated Trust:** The practice of calibrating verification depth to risk level.

**Intent Specification:** Articulation of what code should do and how correctness will be verified, created before code generation.

**Provenance:** The origin and history of code, including whether it was human-written or AI-generated and how it was verified.

**Trust Level:** A classification (High/Moderate/Guarded/Minimal) indicating how much verification is needed for code.

**Verification Ritual:** A consistent set of checks performed after code generation, scaled by risk level.

**VID:** Verified Intent Development — a methodology for AI-augmented software development focused on verification rather than generation.
