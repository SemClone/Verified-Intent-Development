## Chapter 16: Adopting VID

### Starting Points

You can begin VID adoption at different scales:

**Individual adoption.** Start applying VID principles personally. No permission needed. Build skills, see benefits.

**Team adoption.** Agree as a team to apply VID practices. Align on risk calibration and verification standards.

**Organizational adoption.** Formalize VID as development methodology. Provide training and tooling support.

### Starting Small

Don't try to implement everything at once.

**Week 1-2:** Practice intent specification. Before generating, articulate what you need and how you'll verify it.

**Week 3-4:** Add verification rituals. Apply basic rituals consistently. Build the habit.

**Week 5-6:** Start calibrating. Notice which code needs more verification, which needs less.

**Ongoing:** Build the learning loop. Track outcomes, adjust practices.

### Common Obstacles

**"It slows us down."** Yes, verification takes time. But debugging, rework, and incidents take more time. VID front-loads small costs to avoid large costs.

**"AI is good enough."** AI is good at generating code that looks correct. It's not good at guaranteeing correctness, especially for edge cases, security, and maintainability.

**"We don't have time."** You don't have time to not verify. The time you save by skipping verification you spend on debugging and incidents.
