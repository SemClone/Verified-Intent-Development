## Chapter 14: For Senior Engineers

### The Challenge

You've spent years building skills in writing code. AI has commoditized much of that skill. Your role is changing whether you like it or not.

### The Opportunity

Your experience becomes more valuable, not less, when properly applied:

**Judgment.** You've seen what goes wrong. You know the failure modes. This judgment is essential for calibrating trust and verification depth.

**Debugging.** When AI-generated code fails in subtle ways, your experience debugging helps diagnose problems that junior engineers would struggle with.

**Architecture.** AI generates functions and modules. Knowing how to compose them into coherent systems is architecture — still a human skill.

**Mentorship.** Junior engineers need guidance on verification. Your experience informs what to check and how deeply.

### The Shift

Your role shifts from producing code to:

**Specifying intent.** You know what needs to be built. AI generates it. Your understanding of requirements is the input.

**Verifying output.** Your experience identifies what AI gets wrong. You're the quality gate.

**Calibrating trust.** You assess risk and determine appropriate verification levels.

**Building team judgment.** You help junior engineers develop the verification skills you've built over years.

### The Danger

Some senior engineers resist AI-augmented development entirely. This resistance leads to irrelevance as teams that embrace AI move faster.

Other senior engineers over-embrace AI, accepting output without applying their judgment. This throws away the experience advantage.

The VID approach: use your experience to verify better, not to write more.
