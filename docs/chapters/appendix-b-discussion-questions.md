# Appendix B: Discussion Questions

For teams adopting VID, discuss:

1. What's our current approach to AI-generated code? What's working and what isn't?

2. How do we currently calibrate verification depth? Is it working?

3. What problems have escaped to production that verification should have caught?

4. What's our risk tolerance? How do we currently assess risk?

5. How do we build verification skills in junior engineers?

6. What would we need to change about our process to adopt VID?

7. How would we know if VID is working for us?
