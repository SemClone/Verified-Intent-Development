## Chapter 17: The Continuing Evolution

### AI Will Keep Improving

AI capabilities are improving rapidly. Some predictions:

- AI will get better at generating correct code
- AI will get better at self-verification
- AI will get better at explaining generated code
- New failure modes will emerge that we can't predict today

### VID Will Evolve

The principles endure:
- Intent before generation
- Graduated trust based on risk
- Understanding over mere acceptance
- Provenance awareness
- Continuous calibration

The practices will evolve. The specific verification rituals appropriate for 2025's AI will differ from those for 2027's AI. Calibration questions will change as AI capabilities change.

### Your Role in the Evolution

VID isn't complete. It's a starting point — a framework for thinking about AI-augmented development that you can adapt.

As you practice VID:

- **Notice what works and what doesn't** in your context
- **Develop new practices** that address gaps
- **Share what you learn** with others facing similar challenges
- **Adjust as AI evolves** rather than freezing your approach

The developers who navigate the AI transition successfully will be those who develop judgment about verification. VID provides a framework for building that judgment.
