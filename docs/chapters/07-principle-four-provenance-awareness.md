## Chapter 7: Principle Four — Provenance Awareness

### The Principle

**Always know where code came from and what that origin implies.**

Code has provenance — a history of where it came from. In traditional development, provenance is straightforward: a human wrote it. In AI-augmented development, provenance becomes complex and important.

### Why Provenance Matters

**Debugging:** When code fails, knowing its origin helps debug. AI-generated code might fail in ways specific to how AI generates code.

**Modification:** Understanding provenance helps assess modification risk. Code that no one understood when it was generated is harder to modify safely.

**Legal protection:** AI-generated code might inadvertently derive from copyrighted sources. Understanding provenance helps assess and manage this risk.

**Quality assessment:** Different origins have different quality characteristics. Knowing the origin helps calibrate verification.

### Provenance Categories

VID recognizes several provenance categories:

**Human original:** Code written entirely by a human developer. Lowest risk — the developer understood what they wrote.

**AI generated, human verified:** Code generated by AI and carefully reviewed by a human who understood it. Risk depends on verification depth.

**AI generated, lightly reviewed:** Code generated by AI with superficial review. Higher risk — the human might not have caught subtle issues.

**AI generated, unreviewed:** Code accepted without meaningful review. Highest risk.

**Mixed provenance:** Code that combines human-written and AI-generated portions. Risk depends on how well the integration was verified.

### Tracking Provenance

Provenance should be trackable:

- Can you identify which code in your codebase was AI-generated?
- Can you identify who reviewed it and how deeply?
- Can you identify what prompt generated it?

This tracking doesn't need to be elaborate. At minimum:
- Commit messages should indicate AI-assisted generation
- Code review records should indicate review depth
- Teams should maintain awareness of which areas are heavily AI-generated

### Using Provenance

Provenance informs decisions:

**Incident investigation:** "This function is failing. It was AI-generated and received minimal review. The original developer didn't understand the edge cases."

**Modification planning:** "This module is mostly AI-generated with light review. We should budget extra time for understanding before modification."

**Risk assessment:** "This area of the codebase has extensive AI generation with minimal documentation. It's higher risk than areas with clear provenance."
