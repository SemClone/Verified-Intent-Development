## Chapter 15: For Teams and Organizations

### The Team Challenge

Individual VID adoption helps individual developers. Team adoption provides multiplicative benefits.

### Building a Verification Culture

**Normalize verification time.** Verification isn't overhead — it's the work. Build it into estimates and expectations.

**Celebrate catches.** When someone's verification catches a problem, that's a win. Make it visible.

**Discuss failures.** When problems escape verification, discuss what could have caught them. No blame, just learning.

**Share patterns.** When someone finds effective verification approaches, share them with the team.

### Team Calibration

**Align on risk levels.** The team should share understanding of what constitutes low, medium, and high risk for your context.

**Calibrate verification standards.** What does "thorough verification" mean for your team? Agree on concrete practices.

**Review together.** Periodically review as a team: Are our verification practices working? What problems are escaping? What should we adjust?

### Organizational Support

Organizations adopting VID should:

**Train on verification.** Invest in building verification skills, not just tool access.

**Allow verification time.** If velocity metrics don't account for verification time, people will skip verification.

**Track the right metrics.** Measure verified outputs, not raw outputs. Measure problems caught, not just problems shipped.

**Support calibration.** Provide time for teams to review and adjust their practices.
