# Preface

## Who This Book Is For

You're using AI to generate code—or your team is, or soon will be. You've experienced the productivity surge: features that took days now take hours. But you've also felt the nagging uncertainty: *How do I know this code is actually correct?*

This book is for software developers, engineering leaders, and teams who recognize that AI-generated code needs systematic verification, not just deployment. Whether you're a junior engineer learning to work with AI assistants, a senior engineer mentoring others, or a manager building team practices, you'll find practical guidance here.

## What You'll Learn

**Core Skills:**
- How to specify intent before generating code (preventing misalignment)
- How to calibrate verification depth to actual risk (avoiding both negligence and waste)
- How to maintain understanding of code you didn't write (preserving long-term maintainability)
- How to track provenance systematically (knowing what needs extra scrutiny)

**Practical Outcomes:**
- Catch bugs in verification instead of production
- Ship AI-generated code with genuine confidence
- Maintain velocity without accumulating technical debt
- Build verification skills that scale with AI capabilities

## Acknowledgment on AI Assistance

AI language models supported portions of the editorial review, fact validation, and automated build process for this edition. Every AI-assisted contribution went through human verification, alignment with VID principles, and provenance tracking before inclusion.

## How to Use This Book

**If you're an individual developer:**
Start with Chapters 1-3 to understand the paradigm shift, then dive into the five principles (Chapters 4-8) and core practices (Chapters 9-12). The junior engineer curriculum (Chapter 13) provides a structured 12-week learning path regardless of experience level.

**If you're a team lead or manager:**
Read the one-page overview and VID for Engineering Managers guide first, then focus on Chapters 15-16 for team adoption strategies. Use the appendices (D-F) for risk rubrics, decision trees, and ready-made checklists.

**If you're short on time:**
Start with the one-page overview, then read Chapter 4 (Intent Before Generation) and Appendix D (Risk Scoring). Apply those two practices immediately—you'll see results within a week.

## What This Book Is Not

This isn't a prompt engineering guide, an AI tutorial, or a replacement for your current development methodology. VID complements Agile, Scrum, and other processes by addressing the specific gap they don't cover: systematic verification of AI-generated code.

The goal is judgment, not checklists. You'll learn principles that apply whether you're using today's AI tools or whatever emerges in five years.
