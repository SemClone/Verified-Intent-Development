# Preface

This book introduces Verified Intent Development (VID), a methodology designed for software development in an era where artificial intelligence can generate code faster than humans can verify it.

If you learned to code before 2023, everything you know about development workflow is built on a fundamental assumption: **writing code is the hard part**. Methodologies like Agile, Scrum, and Kanban optimize for this assumption. They help teams coordinate the slow, cognitively demanding work of translating requirements into working software.

That assumption is now obsolete.

AI coding assistants can generate functional code in seconds. A junior developer with the right prompts can produce more lines of code in an afternoon than a senior developer could write in a week. The bottleneck has shifted. Writing code is no longer the constraint.

**Verification is.**

The question is no longer "How do we write code faster?" but rather "How do we know the code we generated is correct, secure, maintainable, and legally safe to use?"

VID addresses this new reality. It's not about restricting AI or slowing down development. It's about building the judgment, practices, and habits that allow you to move fast *with confidence*.

This book will teach you how to think about AI-augmented development, not just what steps to follow. The goal is to make you effective whether you're using today's tools or whatever comes next.
