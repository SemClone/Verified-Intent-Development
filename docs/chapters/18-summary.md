## Chapter 18: Summary

### The Core Message

**Code generation is no longer the bottleneck. Verification is.**

The methodology that fits this reality focuses on:
- Building verification skills
- Calibrating verification to risk
- Maintaining understanding of generated code
- Learning from outcomes

### The Five Principles

1. **Intent Before Generation:** Never generate without articulating what you need and how you'll verify it.

2. **Graduated Trust:** Match verification depth to risk level.

3. **Understanding Over Acceptance:** Never accept code you don't understand at an appropriate level.

4. **Provenance Awareness:** Know where code comes from and what that implies.

5. **Continuous Calibration:** Adjust practices based on outcomes.

### The Core Practices

1. **Intent Specification:** Articulate functional requirements, boundaries, and success criteria before generating.

2. **Verification Rituals:** Apply consistent verification practices after every generation, scaled to risk.

3. **Learning Loop:** Track outcomes and adjust practices based on what you learn.

4. **Provenance Hygiene:** Document and maintain awareness of code origins.

### The Path Forward

Start with principles. Apply practices consistently. Calibrate based on outcomes. Build the judgment that verification requires.

The developers who thrive in the AI-augmented future will be those who master verification, not just generation.

VID provides a framework for becoming that developer.
