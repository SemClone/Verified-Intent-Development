## Long-Term Vision (v2.0+)

### Potential Major Evolutions

**When AI capabilities fundamentally change:**
- AI agents that modify production code autonomously
- AI-to-AI code generation (no human in loop)
- Formal verification becomes standard
- AI explains its reasoning completely

**VID v2.0 might need to address:**
- Verification of AI agent decisions
- Trust calibration for autonomous systems
- Human oversight of AI-driven development
- Intent specification for multi-agent systems

**We'll know it's time for v2.0 when:**
- Current principles no longer apply to majority of development
- Fundamental bottleneck shifts again
- New paradigm emerges that invalidates current practices

---

## Community-Driven Roadmap

### How the Community Shapes VID

**Contributions we're actively seeking:**

1. **Real-world validation**
   - Case studies with measurable outcomes
   - Metrics on VID effectiveness
   - A/B comparisons (teams using VID vs. not)

2. **Gap identification**
   - Scenarios VID doesn't handle well
   - Edge cases we haven't considered
   - Conflicting guidance that needs resolution

3. **Adaptation examples**
   - How teams modified VID for their context
   - Industry-specific variations
   - Tool integrations that work well

4. **Evidence gathering**
   - Bug catch rates
   - Time savings data
   - Production incident reduction
   - Team satisfaction metrics

### Roadmap Adjustment Process

**Community input influences roadmap through:**

1. **Issue voting** — Popular requests get prioritized
2. **Pull requests** — Community-contributed content accelerates releases
3. **Discussion threads** — Emerging needs inform direction
4. **Survey feedback** — Periodic community surveys guide focus

**Roadmap review:** Quarterly
**Adjustment:** Based on community needs, AI ecosystem changes, and evidence

- Outdated examples updated or replaced
- More scenarios covered

### Migration Guides

**For MAJOR version changes:**
- 6-month advance notice
- Detailed migration guide
- Both versions supported during transition
- Clear rationale for breaking changes

**For MINOR version changes:**
- Backward compatible
- Existing content remains valid
