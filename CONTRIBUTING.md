## Style Guidelines

### Writing Style

**Voice:** Professional but accessible
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Define terms when first used
- Use active voice
- Be concise

**Tone:** Practical and evidence-based
- Focus on "why" not just "what"
- Use real examples
- Acknowledge trade-offs
- Avoid dogmatism

**Structure:**
- Start with the problem
- Explain the principle
- Show practical application
- Include examples
- Provide templates/checklists when applicable

### Code Examples

**All code examples should:**
- Be realistic (not toy examples)
- Show both "before" and "after" when relevant
- Include comments explaining key points
- Work if copy-pasted (when appropriate)
- Demonstrate VID principles in action

**Prefer:**
- Common languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go)
- Clear variable names
- Minimal dependencies

### Formatting

**Markdown:**
- Use ATX-style headers (`#` not underlines)
- Fence code blocks with language identifiers
- Use tables for structured data
- Keep line length reasonable (<100 chars when possible)

**Diagrams:**
- ASCII diagrams for simple visuals
- Mermaid for complex flowcharts
- Keep accessible (screen reader friendly)

## What We're Looking For

### High Priority

- **Real-world case studies** with measurable outcomes
- **Industry-specific adaptations** (healthcare, fintech, etc.)
- **Metrics and data** on VID effectiveness
- **Edge cases and limitations** we haven't addressed
- **Integration guides** for specific tools/workflows

### Medium Priority

- **Additional examples** for existing practices
- **Improved explanations** of difficult concepts
- **Translation** to other languages
- **Accessibility improvements**
- **Tool integrations** (IDE plugins, CI/CD, etc.)

### Low Priority (But Still Welcome!)

- **Minor wording improvements**
- **Additional references** to related work
- **Formatting enhancements**

---

## What We're NOT Looking For

### Out of Scope

- **Prompt engineering guides** (VID is about verification, not generation)
- **AI model comparisons** (VID is model-agnostic)
- **Productivity hacking** (VID is about correctness, not speed)
- **Generic coding best practices** (unless specific to AI-generated code)
- **Religious debates** about AI (focus on practical methodology)

### Against VID Principles

- **Shortcuts that reduce verification**
- **"Trust the AI" approaches**
- **Eliminating understanding requirements**
- **Risk calibration by convenience rather than actual risk**

---

## Review Process

### Timeline

- **Small changes:** 1 week review
- **Medium changes:** 2-3 weeks review + iteration
- **Large changes:** 4-8 weeks discussion + review

### Review Criteria

Contributions are evaluated on:

1. **Alignment with VID principles**
   - Does it strengthen verification practices?
   - Does it maintain appropriate skepticism?

2. **Practical value**
   - Is it actionable?
   - Does it solve a real problem?
   - Can teams actually use this?

3. **Quality**
   - Is it well-written?
   - Are examples realistic?
   - Is evidence provided?

4. **Scope**
   - Does it fit within VID's focus?
   - Is it the right level of detail?
