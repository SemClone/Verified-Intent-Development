## Which Files Are The "Real" Ones?

### For Distribution (Use These)

**`releases/VID-Methodology.pdf`** ← **Official PDF**
- Tracked in git
- Updated with each release
- This is what you share with readers

**`releases/VID-Methodology.epub`** ← **Official EPUB**
- Tracked in git
- Updated with each release
- Upload this to Amazon KDP, Leanpub, etc.

### For Development (Generated Files)

**`build/VID-Methodology.pdf`** ← Working build
- Generated by `./build-book.sh`
- Gitignored (not tracked)
- Always the latest build
- Copy to `releases/` when ready to release

**`build/VID-Methodology.epub`** ← Working build
- Generated by `./build-book.sh`
- Gitignored (not tracked)
- Always the latest build
- Copy to `releases/` when ready to release

## Build Process

### Step 1: Run the build script
```bash
./build-book.sh
```
This generates:
- `build/VID-Methodology.pdf`
- `build/VID-Methodology.epub`
- `build/VID-Complete.md`
- `manuscript/` (Leanpub format)
- `docs/` (Website)

### Step 2: Review the build
Check `build/` directory for quality:
```bash
ls -lh build/
```

### Step 3: Update releases (when ready)
```bash
cp build/VID-Methodology.pdf releases/
cp build/VID-Methodology.epub releases/
git add releases/
git commit -m "Update release artifacts with latest build"
```

### Step 4: Push changes
```bash
git push
```

## What Gets Tracked in Git

| Directory/File | Tracked? | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| `build/` | ❌ No (gitignored) | Working build directory |
| `releases/` | ✅ Yes | Official release artifacts |
| `manuscript/` | ❌ No (gitignored) | Leanpub format (generated) |
| `docs/` | ✅ Yes | Website source files |
| `chapters/` | ✅ Yes | Source markdown files |

## Quick Reference

**I want to share the book with someone:**
→ Use `releases/VID-Methodology.pdf`

**I want to publish to Leanpub:**
→ Upload `manuscript/` directory

**I want to publish to Amazon KDP:**
→ Upload `releases/VID-Methodology.epub`

**I want to deploy the website:**
→ Deploy `docs/` directory to GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.

**I just made changes to chapters:**
→ Run `./build-book.sh`, then copy from `build/` to `releases/` when ready

**I want to see the latest build:**
→ Check `build/` directory (after running `./build-book.sh`)

## File Size Reference

As of January 3, 2026:
- PDF: ~415 KB (includes all editorial improvements)
- EPUB: ~121 KB (includes all editorial improvements)

Older releases (December 25, 2025):
- PDF: ~309 KB (before PR #8 improvements)
- EPUB: ~89 KB (before PR #8 improvements)

## Build Frequency

Run `./build-book.sh` whenever:
- ✅ You modify any chapter files
- ✅ You want to preview changes in PDF/EPUB
- ✅ You're preparing a release
- ✅ You're updating the website

Don't commit `build/` or `manuscript/` (they're gitignored). Only commit `releases/` when you're ready to publish.
