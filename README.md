## About This Book

This book introduces Verified Intent Development (VID), a methodology designed for software development in an era where artificial intelligence can generate code faster than humans can verify it.

**The core insight:** Code generation is no longer the bottleneck. Verification is.

VID addresses this new reality by building the judgment, practices, and habits that allow developers to move fast *with confidence*.

## Reading the Book

The VID Methodology is organized as individual chapters for optimal accessibility:

**AI-friendly** — Each chapter fits in context windows
**Modular** — Read what you need, when you need it
**Maintainable** — Updates don't invalidate entire context
**Flexible** — Combine chapters as needed for your learning path

## The Five Principles

1. **Intent Before Generation** - Never generate code without first articulating what you intend to build and how you will verify correctness
2. **Graduated Trust** - The level of verification should match the level of risk
3. **Understanding Over Acceptance** - Never accept code you don't understand at an appropriate level of depth
4. **Provenance Awareness** - Always know where code came from and what that origin implies
5. **Continuous Calibration** - Regularly assess whether your verification practices match actual risk and adjust accordingly

---

## The Core Practices

1. **Intent Specification** - Articulate functional requirements, boundaries, and success criteria before generating
2. **Verification Rituals** - Apply consistent verification practices after every generation, scaled to risk
3. **Learning Loop** - Track outcomes and adjust practices based on what you learn
4. **Provenance Hygiene** - Document and maintain awareness of code origins

- **Assessing risk** → [Chapter 5: Graduated Trust](chapters/05-principle-two-graduated-trust.md) + [Appendix D: Risk Scoring Rubric](chapters/appendix-d-risk-scoring-rubric.md) + [VID Templates](resources/VID-Templates.md)
- **Reviewing code** → [Chapter 20: The Verification Toolkit](chapters/20-the-verification-toolkit.md) + [VID Templates](resources/VID-Templates.md)
- **Verifying tests** → [Chapter 21: Test Verification Framework](chapters/21-test-verification-framework.md)
- **Learning from failures** → [Chapter 19: Patterns and Anti-Patterns](chapters/19-patterns-and-anti-patterns.md) + [Chapter 22: Real-World Examples](chapters/22-real-world-examples.md)
